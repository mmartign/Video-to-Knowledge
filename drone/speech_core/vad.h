// Energy + zero-crossing-rate voice activity detection. Classic,
// dependency-free VAD suitable as a gate in front of speech recognition:
// speech tends to combine moderate-to-high short-term energy with a
// zero-crossing rate in a mid range (voiced speech has more structure
// than broadband noise, but crosses zero less often than high-frequency
// noise/hiss).
